# GEMspa

This program will calculate the Diffusion coefficient for trajectories from single particle tracking.  The input files are expected to be in .csv format, as output from MOSAIC Fiji plugin.  They must have headers titled: Trajectory, Frame, x, y.  (Any additional columns will be ignored)

Please refer to the GEMspa user manual in the docs folder for full instructions.
